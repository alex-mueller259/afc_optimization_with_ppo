# AFC optimization with PPO
### Optimizing active flow control parameters using reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization (PPO)

This is the code that was used to obtain measurement data and to run the PPO algorithm as explained in the paper "*Optimizing pulsed blowing parameters for active separation control in a one-sided diffuser using reinforcement learning*" by MÃ¼ller et al. that was submitted to the STAB conference journal on November 9th 2024.

The PPO algorithm is based on the paper "*Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms*" by Schulman et al.  
https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347

The code is derived from existing PPO implementations in Python.

> Please note that the project is still a work-in-progress as it is part of an ongoing master's thesis.
